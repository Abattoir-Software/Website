				<p>In the future, where do you think aliens will go to slug it out in a battle to the end? That worthless
				little planet, Earth, of course! <i>Galaxy Arena Earth</i> has you battling against your
				enemy where you have to use everything you can to beat your opponent. If you punches aren't working,
				why not throw a bench, a car or even a humongous statue? Destroy your enemy  or even destroy the
				buildings that litter the planet.</p>

				<p><i>Galaxy Arena Earth</i> is a final project for three Game majors at <a href="http://www.bloomfield.edu" target="_blank"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></i>
				Bloomfield College</a>. Using a modified version of the <a href="http://www.garagegames.com" target="_blank"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></i> Torque Game
				Engine</a>, the game will allow players to fight each other in the streets of a futuristic Earth. The game started to be developed at the end of January 2007. A playable
				demo, showing the basic concept of the game working was completed by May of 2007, for college credits. Concept art and character modeling was done by Brett Ryans.
				Raymond Rivera did the modeling environments, object and technical art. Programming was worked on by Christopher Pollati.<br />
