			<p>Here is a set of icons for network drives made with the GlowIcons style. Included in this batch are icons for generic networked drives, Amiga formatted (with either the red square or boing ball for your liking), network and regular window$ drive, and also a regular and networked Linux drive. As an added bonus, there is an icon which was designed for SMBNet.</p>
